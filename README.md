Heya!

Welcome to the sausage factorial, a.k.a. the bs batcave, the content catacombs, the monkey business mantion, and the bits bonanza.

In other words, this is the source repo of https://erangi.github.io/podcasts, which is my page of recommended podcasts (mostly technical).

Please, come inside and look around. Not talking about this source repo, of course. Nothing interesting in a markdown file. But do look at the podcasts recommendations website. I recommend them all, imagine that.

If you have any other podcast to suggest, feel free to let me know via the discussions page or https://linkedin.com/in/erangi.
