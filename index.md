I'm an avid podcast listener. Listening to podcasts is, to me, both a way to make long walks and commutes more interesting and a way to keep learning new things.
Granted, podcasts are a very ineffective teaching format, and they are by no means comparable to proper study. Still, with ~2 hours of listening on an average day at x1.3 play speed,
I find listening to podcasts useful and interesting.

I listen regularly to all of the podcasts listed in this page, so I recommend them all. I don't like them all the same, and you might have a very different opinion.
This is not an expert review or authoritative ranking. I'm generally interested in performance-oriented code, infrastructure systems, database internals, etc. This led to my mix of subscriptions.

My listening routine is as follows: once my playlist ends, I go over all the podcasts, pick up to a few episodes from each (or none, if none are interesting), and create a new playlist for the next couple of months.
I don't listen to all episodes in any podcast. I interleave non-technical podcasts in my playlist to lighten it up a bit. There are obviously numerous non-technical podcasts that are very interesting,
and my "guilty pleasure" is music.

I tried to listen to conference talks (via youtube, sound only) or academic papers (text to speech) for deeper technical content. Didn't work for me.
I do read books regularly, in paper format. Visiting the library is a treat, but it takes me a few months to complete a book. I'm ok with that and am not interested in audiobooks.

Below is my list, divided into categories. I'll be happy to get recommendations for other podcasts covering these topics via [my linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erangi_podcast-recommendations-activity-7208523669243887616-wKMN) or [the discussions page](https://github.com/erangi/podcasts/discussions).
